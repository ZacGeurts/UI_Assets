# THIS IS NOT FLATUX
# UI_Assets
Retroarch icon collection for the UI

Went with realistic.
I may be biased but I think mine is the best :D
Replacing images from xmb\flatux so not all are mine yet. WIP
Replace them all if you want and do what you want with it.
I do not know how yet to just add a new folder to the asstes and want to do something else for a while.
