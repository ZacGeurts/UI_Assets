# THIS IS NOT FLATUX
# UI_Assets
If you use the update assets in the downloader you MAY REVERT your ui.<BR />
By the end I intend to make this a seperate theme.<BR /><BR />
Retroarch icon collection for the UI<BR />
For now do not get the releases, click the green code button and download as ZIP.<BR />
Releases tend to be behind the commits and I am just adding more content icons.<BR />
<BR />
Creative Commons applies to the FlatUX images that were not yet replaced.<BR />
<BR />
Went with realistic. Not all images are from me yet. WIP<BR />
Delete or replace bg.png if you do not like the background or have a different layout.<BR />
I like titles above screentshot on the right and boxart as the logo.<BR />
Replacing images from xmb\flatux and others so not all are mine yet. WIP<BR />
I have avoided image locations where copyright is enforced. Generally images off the packaging, edited off the box, ebay postings, or sites that claim free for commercial use. This is not commercial.<BR />
Replace them all if you want and do what you want with it.<BR />
I do not know how yet to just add a new folder to the assets and periodically update when taking a break.<BR />
<BR />
I recommend downloading, extract, open the folder and hold CTRL key and just click to select all the ones you like, then right click copy, and paste the ones you like over/into a theme folder and overwrite. I recommend overwriting a theme not your current main one.

A recommendation for background music, convert and rename to assets/sound/bgm.ogg. I cannot provide, site is misleading "Public Domain". Reduced volume by 75% to 25% when converting.<BR />
