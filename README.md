Went with realistic. Not all images are from me yet. WIP<BR />
I may be biased but I think mine is the best :D<BR />
Replacing images from xmb\flatux and others so not all are mine yet. WIP<BR />
Replace them all if you want and do what you want with it.<BR />
I do not know how yet to just add a new folder to the assets and periodically update when taking a break.<BR />
<BR />
I recommend downloading, extract, open the folder and hold CTRL key and just click to select all the ones you like, then right click copy, and paste the ones you like in your current theme folder and overwrite. This is version pre 1.0 so that is why the install is junk.

A recommendation for background music, convert and rename to assets/sound/bgm.ogg. I cannot provide, site is misleading.<BR />
I reduced volume to 25% when converting.<BR />
