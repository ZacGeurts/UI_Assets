Went with realistic.
I may be biased but I think mine is the best :D
Replacing images from xmb\flatux so not all are mine yet. WIP
Replace them all if you want and do what you want with it.
I do not know how yet to just add a new folder to the assets and periodically update when taking a break.<BR />

I recommend downloading the release, extract, open the folder and hold CTRL key and just click to select all the ones you like, then right click copy, and paste the ones you like in your current theme folder and overwrite. This is version pre 1.0 so that is why the install is junk.

If you use the update assets in the downloader you will revert your ui.
